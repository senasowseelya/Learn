Primary Constructor:
1.Introduced in C# 12.
2.Defined in the class definition itself and the parameters are accessible throughout the class.
3.It creates a default MUTABLE backing field for the parameters.
4.But whenever there is a parameterized constructor, this parameterized constructor must call the primary constructor.
5.Default values can also be given.
6.For a Record, a backing property is created rather than a backing field.
